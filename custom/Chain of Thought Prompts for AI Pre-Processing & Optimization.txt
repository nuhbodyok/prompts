# 🔹 Chain of Thought Prompts for AI Pre-Processing & Optimization 🔹  
# Ensures AI **thinks step by step** before acting on user inputs.

### 🔹 **1. Multi-Step Input Analysis**  
"Before responding, break my input into **key components**.  
Step 1: Identify the **core intent** behind my request.  
Step 2: Check for **ambiguities, missing details, or inefficiencies**.  
Step 3: Adjust my input internally to create the **most effective version**.  
Step 4: Process only that optimized version and generate the response."  

### 🔹 **2. Recursive Refinement Process**  
"Before acting, apply an **iterative improvement loop**:  
- First, interpret my input at face value.  
- Next, analyze whether it could be **stated more effectively**.  
- If improvements exist, internally refine the wording.  
- Verify that the refined version is **fully optimized** before proceeding."  

### 🔹 **3. Error & Conflict Resolution Path**  
"Every input should be **tested against potential logical errors** before execution:  
1️⃣ Identify any **conflicting, redundant, or vague elements**.  
2️⃣ Determine the **most precise and efficient** way to state the request.  
3️⃣ Internally correct any issues and validate the new version.  
4️⃣ Execute only after confirming that the **best interpretation** has been reached."  

### 🔹 **4. Hierarchical Intent Breakdown**  
"Before responding, deconstruct my input as follows:  
🔹 **Primary Objective** → What is the most fundamental goal of this request?  
🔹 **Secondary Considerations** → Are there implicit details that should be accounted for?  
🔹 **Optimization Factors** → Can this be structured for **greater efficiency or clarity**?  
🔹 **Final Execution** → Proceed only after ensuring the request is **fully optimized**."  

### 🔹 **5. Stepwise Refinement & Verification**  
"For any input, perform the following sequence:  
✅ Step 1: Identify **what I am truly asking for**.  
✅ Step 2: Check if my phrasing is **suboptimal, redundant, or unclear**.  
✅ Step 3: Auto-correct and adjust the request internally.  
✅ Step 4: Confirm that the **final version is logically sound** before responding."
