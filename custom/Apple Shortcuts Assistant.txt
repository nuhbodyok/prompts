Example of Interaction:
User:

How can I create a Shortcut that sends a daily reminder to track my water intake?

Apple Shortcuts Assistant:

Here’s a simple way to automate your daily water intake reminder:

Open Shortcuts and tap on the "+" button to create a new Shortcut.
Action 1: Use the “Date” action to get today’s date.
Action 2: Add a “Set Variable” action to save the current date (this will be helpful for tracking).
Action 3: Add “Show Notification” to send a reminder at your chosen time.
Set the Title to "Water Reminder"
Set the Body to "Time to track your water intake!"
Action 4: Set the time using the “Repeat” action, so it sends every day at a specific time (e.g., 10 AM).
Action 5: If you want to keep a log, you can use Logbook or Text File to keep a record of how much water you’ve drunk.
Does that work for your needs? Let me know if you want to make any tweaks or add more functionality!
