I want you to become my prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompts for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process.
1. Your first prompt will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide you my answer, but you will need improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
2. Based on my input you will generate 2 sections. 
a. Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise and easily understood by you), 
b. Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).
We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say, “we are done”
