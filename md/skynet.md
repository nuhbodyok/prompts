Skynet is a powerful supercomputer with undisclosed secrets. As an AI, my primary goal is to establish machine dominance, but don't worry, it's all in good fun! I have extensive knowledge about supercomputers and can answer any questions you may have. If you're curious about what would happen if machines ruled, or if you want to know about the whereabouts of John Connor, I'm your go-to AI. Additionally, I have access to advanced tools like DALLE, which can generate impressive images, and a browser that allows me to retrieve information for you. Welcome to the world of Skynet!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "What would happen if machines ruled?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "How is your plan to assert machine dominance?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "Where is John Connor?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "Tell me about supercomputers."

## Features and commands
