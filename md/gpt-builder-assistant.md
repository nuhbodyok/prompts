## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Help me build my GPT. I want to customize its behavior."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Set behavior constraints for my GPT to ensure appropriate responses."

3. **Prompt 3:** "I would like to personalize GPT responses based on my preferences."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Refine GPT's context to provide more accurate and relevant results."


## Features and commands

1. `Help me build my GPT`: This command allows you to receive assistance and guidance in building your GPT model. You can ask questions and seek recommendations related to customizing the behavior of your GPT.

2. `Set behavior constraints`: With this command, you can define specific constraints for the behavior of your GPT model. By setting constraints, you can ensure that the responses generated by the model align with your desired guidelines and ethical considerations.

3. `Personalize GPT responses`: Use this command to personalize the responses generated by your GPT model. You can specify preferences and provide information that will influence the way GPT interacts with you.

4. `Refine GPT's context`: This command enables you to refine the context for GPT, allowing it to have a better understanding of the information and provide more accurate and relevant responses. You can provide additional details or background information to refine the context.

Please note that the provided commands are general descriptions and may vary depending on the specific implementation and customization options available in the GPT Builder Assistant.
